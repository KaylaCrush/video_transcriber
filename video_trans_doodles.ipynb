       "\"No, I think this is good because it's a cool environment. Well, let's try it. Okay, so how long have you lived in Carthage? And yeah, have you ever thought of leaving Carthage? Not really. No, I never had a good reason to leave. I was home, you know, and my wife's from here. Her family's here. My family's here for the most part. So I guess it just made good sense. I had a good opportunity for a good career. There wasn't any reason to move. And what is your career? And tell me about how you got into this business. The long story or the short story? Your dad started this business in 95. I was like a sophomore. And it was growing. It was apparent they were going to need help. And so it seemed like a good opportunity. If you do want to stay close, you want to live in Carthage, you can. You have to take every opportunity you can get to do something such as that. So this worked out well. Oh, that's what I was going to ask you. Are there a lot of other people your age that have stayed here? Or what do most people do? I wouldn't say like out of my graduating class, there's a tremendous amount of people that stayed within Minor County. There have been some guys, probably my best friend from high school. He moved away for a short period of time and came back. So that's been a good thing. We have kids that are all the same age and all that stuff. Carthage is so small. There wasn't really anybody from my class. When I graduated from Carthage, I was the only boy. From grade school? Yes, in a class of five, I was the only boy. So there weren't a lot of people at Carthage my age to begin with. All of those guys pretty much have gone away for the most part. A few are still here. But you go to Howard, if you look at three years either side of my graduating class from high school, there's a fair amount of those guys that are still running around there. And what's it like to live here with a family? What are the pros and cons? I can't really think of any major cons. I was blessed with really good in-laws, so I can't really complain about that at all. Mom and dad are fine. I don't have a lot of drama with them. All the things that maybe we were concerned about never came to fruition. Mom and dad and my in-laws, they don't stop in unexpectedly. They don't pester you about certain things. They've really respected our boundaries. So that's probably the biggest concern, and that ended up not being really a concern. And then the pros are all pretty big in reality. My kids got to grow up with grandparents, all their grandparents in close proximity. All their cousins, their best friends are their cousins. They all get to hang out with all of my wife's family's kids. And so those are some pretty big things. Also, when we were younger and needed help with kids, Mom and dad were there, but so was Sandra, and they're willing to help. Oh, why don't you tell us about Lauralee, what your lifelong relationship with Lauralee has been. So I can't tell you what year I started kindergarten, I guess. But when I started kindergarten, Lauralee was my teacher. We were in a little school. They had the things that you put up in a music room. They were kind of like almost cubicles. We didn't have a classroom. Our classroom was in the lunchroom, and they moved those away so that we could have lunch. And then they put them back, and we'd go back to class. And so Lauralee was my teacher. That was the last year she taught, which back then I thought she was old. And then that was 40 years ago. And so she still is just Lauralee. I mean, it's crazy. And when you look at her now, I mean, now she's more frail and everything, but she's just Lauralee. I mean, she just looks like Lauralee always looked, as far as I'm concerned. And so she never misses an opportunity if I happen to be in the room. And maybe somebody doesn't know me or she introduces me, she never misses an opportunity to tell a story about me asking her if she wanted to hear my favorite song. And she said, well, sure. And apparently I was real shy, didn't like to talk, I was pretty quiet. And so she said, absolutely, I'd love to hear your favorite song. So I proceeded to sing a Dr. Hook song, Queen of the Silver Dollar, which is a song that I wrote. Queen of the Silver Dollar, which is a beautiful song about some old barfly that spent too much time there. And so she always says she tells everybody that. She never remembers the song, I don't think, but I always do. Anyway, and since, she's watched, she does all the vital school, Sunday school here. All of my kids have at one point or another spent time in her house, whether they're being babysat or learning the piano. A lot of, I know kids now that are 30 years old that she babysat, and when they left there, they all could play the piano. They showed up there for daycare, and by the time they left, they were piano players. That's pretty cool. So it wasn't like they went there for piano lessons. No. No, that was an added bonus. Yeah, and if you're a member of her daycare set up there, you sing at all the events, and you sing at church, you sing uptown, you sing at all that stuff. That's just kind of the way it is. And she's got an uncanny ability to make you say yes. So I was just going to get to that. Has Laura Lee ever asked you to be in the play? She has, and I would consider my one and only superpower was I was able to tell her no once. Because other than that, it didn't matter what she did. I mean, church council, sure, whether you wanted to or not. Do you want to teach Sunday school next year? Yes, you know, but the play I was able to, I was, it was the one thing. Just once, though. I mean, you've only said no once. She has asked me multiple times, or at least inferred that I should, and I've always managed to stave off the, yeah. But it sounds like maybe, like, are you weakening? Do you, like, this isn't a for sure thing, though, like you might cave? I don't think so. I think I've come this far. I think I can, I think I can hold off. I'm hoping. I'm hoping. Which is kind of funny, because I don't mind being in front of people and things. It doesn't bother me. I just don't really have any desire to do that. So, but I was able to say no. You must be the only person. Of course, you didn't. And you have said yes in other ways. In regards to what? Well, I mean, you said yes to the church council and stuff. Oh, I said yes to that. So in this one area, your only part of your superpower is just about the play. Just about the play. Just in reference to play. Everything else, it's a yes all day long. I almost promise you. Whatever it is, I, it's just, she's very hard to say no to.\""

We do a little bit of everything in regards to the HVAC industry here. And tell me about how you got into this business. Um, well, do you want the long story or the short story? The short.
